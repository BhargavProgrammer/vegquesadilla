Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in a large non-stick sauté pan.  Add sweet potato and sauté for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked through.  Transfer to a separate plate and set aside.
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan.  Add the veggies and jalapeño, and sauté for 4-5 minutes.  Stir in the cooked sweet potato, black beans, cumin, chili powder, a generous pinch of salt and black pepper, and sauté for 2 more minutes.  Taste and add more salt, pepper and/or cumin if needed.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and set aside.  Rinse (or just wipe off) the sauté pan until it is clean.
Return the sauté pan to the stove, and reduce heat to medium.  Place a tortilla* in the center of the pan and immediately sprinkle your desired amount of cheese evenly over the surface of the tortilla.  Add a few large spoonfuls (about 1 cup) of the veggie mixture on one half of the tortilla, then sprinkle on some cilantro.  Fold the other side of the tortilla over to create a half moon.  Continue cooking for another 30 seconds or so, or until the bottom of the tortilla is crisp and golden.  (Just lift it up and take a peek to see when it’s ready to go.)  Then carefully flip the tortilla over and cook it for an additional 30-60 seconds on the second side.
Transfer to a serving plate*, slice into triangles, then repeat with the remaining ingredients.
Serve warm, along with your favorite salsa, guacamole and/or sour cream for dipping.
